# Emergency-Vehicle-Identification

## Abstract
Fatalities due to traffic delays of emergency vehicles such as ambulance & fire brigade is a huge problem. In daily life, we often see that emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic. So differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring as well as self drive car systems as reaching on time to their destination is critical for these services. Experimental evaluations in both simulated and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate the system’s effectiveness. It significantly improves traffic flow efficiency, emergency vehicle response times, and overall traffic management.

## Introduction
Urban traffic congestion is a persistent challenge faced by cities worldwide. In bustling metropolitan areas, traffic jams can significantly hinder emergency services’ ability to respond swiftly. When every second counts, delays caused by congested intersections can have life-altering consequences. This pressing issue underscores the critical need for an effective Emergency Vehicle Identification System. Emergency vehicles—such as ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars—play a vital role in saving lives. However, their effectiveness depends on how quickly they can reach their destinations.
An identification system ensures that emergency vehicles receive priority passage through traffic. By dynamically adjusting traffic signals, these vehicles can navigate intersections without unnecessary delays. Congested roads not only slow down regular commuters but also impede emergency services. When traffic grinds to a halt, ambulances carrying critically ill patients or firefighters responding to emergencies face significant obstacles. Minimizing delays allows emergency vehicles to cover more ground efficiently. Proper resource allocation ensures better coverage across the city.  Ultimately, an efficient emergency vehicle identification system contributes to community safety, well-being, and resilience. - By facilitating rapid emergency responses, cities become more resilient in the face of crises.Automated alerts triggered by the identification system can notify emergency responders about nearby emergencies, allowing them to plan their routes and responses more effectively
Self-driving cars need to see and react to the world around them, just like human drivers. Emergency vehicle identification is a crucial technology for autonomous vehicles. By recognizing flashing lights, sirens, and distinct emergency vehicle shapes, self-driving cars can safely yield the right of way, ensuring smoother emergency response and keeping everyone on the road safer.
This tech is crucial for building trust in self-driving cars. The ability to navigate emergency situations smoothly demonstrates an autonomous car's ability to handle complex situations, making them safer for everyone

## Description:
### Objective:
The main objective is to build an Artificial Neural Network Model which Identifies the Emergency Vehicles.

### Data Collection:
The dataset contains the 2 types of files, one file contains the images of vehicles and other file contains the labels for the vehicles 0-non-emergency and 1-emergency vehicle.

### Data Preprocessing:
The images will be of different sizes and resolution, images need to be normalized and rescaled.

## Model:
Sequential Model is used for training the dataset, Sequential model is a specific type of neural network architecture offered by libraries like Keras for building deep learning models. It excels at situations where layers are stacked in a linear, one-dimensional fashion. Imagine building a block tower, where each block sits directly on top of the previous one. That's the core concept behind a Sequential model.
Layers are added in the Network sequentially and added with optimizer called “adam” and also used the “accuracy”.

## Testing:
Model is tested with the test data, test data is loaded into the prediction method and tested with the best weights that are saved into the model.

## Model Evaluation:
The best model that is saved on hd5 file is loaded into the model and compiled for best results and the model is evaluated with the accuracy score.

## Conclusion: 
The emergency vehicle identification project holds significant promise for enhancing public safety and improving response times in critical situations. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, this project offers a robust solution for automatically recognizing emergency vehicles on the road.
